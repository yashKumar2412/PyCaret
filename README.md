# PyCaret
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this repository to display my work for the assignment on PyCaret As of now, there are six Jupyter Notebooks attached, each for a category of Data Science subproblem:
1. Regression - Boston Housing Prices dataset
2. Classification (Binary) - Titanic dataset
3. Classification (Multiclass) - Satellite dataset
4. Clustering - Pokemon dataset
5. Anomaly Detection - Anomaly dataset
6. Association Mining - Germany Market Basket dataset
7. Time Series 1 (No Exogenous Factors) - PyCaret downloads dataset

For a walkthrough of the notebooks, refer the following YouTube videos:
1. [Regression & Classification](https://youtu.be/GZTmRp87uzY?si=sKAN2xa0kvFX1Zyn)
2. [Clustering, Anomaly Detection & Association Mining](https://youtu.be/40yD3J9s-ng)

The walkthrough videos for others will be attached once it is uploaded to YouTube successfully.
