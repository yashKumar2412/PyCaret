As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this repository to display my work for the assignment on PyCaret As of now, there are six Jupyter Notebooks attached, each for a category of Data Science subproblem:
1. Regression - Boston Housing Prices dataset
2. Classification (Binary) - Titanic dataset
3. Classification (Multiclass) - Satellite dataset
4. Clustering - Pokemon dataset
5. Anomaly Detection - Anomaly dataset
6. Association Mining - Germany Market Basket dataset

The walkthrough videos for the same will be attached once it is uploaded to YouTube successfully.
